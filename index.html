        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In recent years, cloud computing has become increasingly popular due to its scalability,
            flexibility, and
            cost-effectiveness. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud service providers, offering a wide
            range of services for various business needs. AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline are three powerful
            tools provided by AWS for automating the building, testing, and deploying of applications.
            <br>
            <br>
            Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) has become an essential practice in modern software
            development. It involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software changes,
            allowing teams to deliver new features and bug fixes more quickly and efficiently. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
            provides a range of services and tools that enable organizations to implement robust and scalable CI/CD
            pipelines.

    <div class="content" id="codebuild" style="color: blueviolet;">
        <h2 style="background-color: #ddd;">CodeBuild Section</h2>
        <p> AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and creates software
            packages automatically. It eliminates the need to set up and maintain your own build servers, reducing
            infrastructure costs and improving productivity. CodeBuild integrates with popular code repositories like
            AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, and Bitbucket, allowing you to trigger builds whenever changes are made to your
            source code.
            <br>
            <br>
            CodeBuild supports multiple programming languages and build environments, providing a flexible solution for
            building applications written in different frameworks. It also supports custom build environments, allowing
            you to use your own build tools and scripts. With CodeBuild, you can build, test, and package your
            applications quickly and reliably, ensuring high-quality software releases.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="codedeploy" style="color: rgb(232, 9, 209);">
        <h2>CodeDeploy Section</h2>
        <p>AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that
            automates the process of deploying. applications to
            various instances, such as Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, and Lambda functions. CodeDeploy
            simplifies deployments by eliminating manual steps and providing a consistent and reliable deployment
            process.
            <br>
            <br>
            CodeDeploy allows you to define deployment configurations, which specify the deployment settings, such as
            the deployment type (in-place or blue/green), the deployment groups, and the desired state of the instances.
            These configurations can be defined using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the APIs.
            <br>
            <br>
            CodeDeploy integrates seamlessly with CodePipeline, allowing you to create a continuous delivery pipeline
            for your applications. This enables you to automate the entire release process, from building and testing
            your applications with CodeBuild to deploying them with CodeDeploy.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class=" content" id="codepipeline" style="color: rgb(238, 107, 7);">
        <h2>CodePipeline Section</h2>
        <p>AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that enables you to automate your software
            release process. It allows you to define a series of stages, where each stage can represent a specific
            action, such as building, testing, and deploying your application. CodePipeline automates the transition of
            your application artifacts between stages, ensuring a smooth and reliable release process.
            <br>
            CodePipeline integrates with various AWS services, including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and
            CloudFormation, as well as third-party tools like Jenkins, allowing you to create a comprehensive and
            customizable pipeline for your applications.
            <br>
            Within CodePipeline, you can define the flow of your pipeline by specifying the source, build, test, and
            deploy stages. Each stage can have multiple actions, such as running unit tests or deploying to a specific
            environment. CodePipeline provides a visual representation of your pipeline, allowing you to easily track
            the flow and status of your deployments.

            <br>
            <br>

            2. AWS CodeArtifact: CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that enables you to
            securely store, publish, and manage software artifacts. It integrates with CodeBuild and CodePipeline,
            providing a centralized location for storing your build dependencies.
            <br>
            <br>

            3. AWS CloudFormation: CloudFormation is a service that allows you to create and manage AWS resources using
            YAML or JSON templates. It can be used to define and provision the infrastructure required for your
            applications, including compute resources, storage, networking, and more.
